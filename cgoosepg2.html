			<p>Canada Goose is guilty of serious animal cruelty. The fur that lines their hoods is real coyote fur, and the insulation inside their coats is real goose down. The practices used to hunt coyotes causes them great distressâ€”-traps that clamp down on their legs not hard enough to break their legs but hard enough such that they cannot break free and their legs go numb. Coyotes are very social animals, so being trapped is very stressful for them. Their desperation to be free leads some of the coyotes to try to bite their way out of the traps, and sometimes unintentionally bite their leg off instead of the trap. Geese also suffer in order for these jackets to be made. Canada Goose gets their downs and feathers from waterfowl meat industries who claim to use ethical tratment of the birds before they die. However, videos have been leaked showing farmers throwing geese by the neck into cramped cages on trucks to be shipped to procesing plants.</p>
