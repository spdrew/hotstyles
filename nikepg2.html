			<p>Each day, Nike sells over two million pairs of shoes, which creates unimaginable amounts of waste from packaging. Furthermore, Nike's manufacturing facilities use horrifyingly unethical treatment of their workers. Nike uses child labor and forced labor of Uyhgar Muslims, and allegedly facilitates sexual harassment and discriminatory practices among workers. The chemicals they use to create their products are extremely toxic and harm both the environment and their workers, and have no labor rights groups protecting their workers from being subjected to such miserable conditions.</p>
