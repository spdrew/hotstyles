			<p>H&M is guilty of using various unethical practices in producing its clothing. The company does not pay its workers living wages and only joined the Bangladesh Fire Safety Accord after a factory collapsed in 2013, killing over 1,000 workers. Their designs are trendy, and clothes go out-of-stlye and get discarded after only a few months. Additionally, H&M uses harmful dyes and chemicals in their clothes that pollute rivers, and is a large contributer to global carbon emmissions.</p>
