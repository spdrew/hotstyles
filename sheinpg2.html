			<p>Shein is one of the most unethical fast fashion brands on the market. They have a system used to track societal trends that allows them to release hundreds of new designs in less than a week. Because of this, their clothes are cheaply made and end up going out of style or falling apart in a short amount of time. Their clothes are made of synthetic fabrics that do not decompose, and the company has made no effort to reduce the amount of waste they produce. Additionally, the designs Shein puts on their clothes is often art that is stolen from small creators or art that appropriates other cultures. The company is also secretive about their use of child labor or if their factory workers make living wages.</p>
