			<p>Adidas has been exposed for using child labor and forced labor of Uyghur Muslims. They also chemically treat their products to make them more durable, but the chemicals they use pollute the rivers they dump into, effectively killing the wildlife that lives there. Their products are made using synthetic fibers that do not decay, so they will pollute the planet for hundreds of years to come. Adidas also failed to meet its goal for producing zero harmful chemical waste by 2020, so it is clear that they do not care about the catastrophic effects their production methods have on the environment.</p>
